Project Details
---------------
Project Title: Rhythm Game

Project Description: A rhythm game where the player will try to press the FGPA board buttons in sync with 'notes' that pass by on the screen.

Proposal
--------

What do you plan to have completed by the end of the first lab session?:
- Shifter bits with loading and reading for 100 bits
- Timer to shift notes to simulate playing song
- Counter to increase score
- Have a working "animation" of a moving block

What do you plan to have completed by the end of the second lab session?:
- Output rhythm to VGA
- Have score increase if buttons pressed in the right time
- make script to generate rhythm bits

What do you plan to have completed by the end of the third lab session?:
- Multiple songs to choose from

- Fix bugs in edge cases
- Add additional features if time permits (eg. receive sounds from a microphone, output notes to speaker)

What is your backup plan if things don't work out as planned?
- If VGA doesn't work, last resort is moving lights in LEDR


What hardware will you need beyond the DE2 board?
Speakers, Microphone (if time permits)


Motivations
-----------
How does this project relate to the material covered in CSCB58?:
It implements and brings together many components we have used (timers, shifter bits, finite state machines)

Why is this project interesting/cool (for CSCB58 students, and for non CSCB58 students?):
- It's a rhythm game that is made by hardware, not the typical rhythm game programmed in Java

Why did you personally choose this project?:
- It allows us to demonstrate our understanding in many parts of the course syllabus, such as outputting to VGA, shifting bits, using finite state machines, counters, etc.
- Because we love rhythm games
- Because we like music
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ <- Our inspiration

Updates

<Example update. Delte this and add your own updates after each lab session>
Week 1: We built the hardware and tested the sensors. The distance sensor we had intended to use didn't work as
expected (wasn't precise enough at further distances, only seems to work accurately within 5-10cm), so instead
we've decided to change the project to use a light sensor instead. Had trouble getting the FSM to work (kept
getting stuck in state 101, took longer to debug than expected), so we may not be able to add the
high score feature, have updated that in the project description as (optional).
