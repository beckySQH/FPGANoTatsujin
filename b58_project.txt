Project Details
---------------
Project Title: Rhythm Game

Project Description: A rhythm game where the player will try to press the FGPA board buttons in sync with 'notes' that pass by on the screen.

Proposal
--------

What do you plan to have completed by the end of the first lab session?:
- Shifter bits with loading and reading for 100 bits (unable)
- Timer to shift notes to simulate playing song (unable)
- Counter to increase score (not attempted)
- Have a working "animation" of a moving block (unable)

What do you plan to have completed by the end of the second lab session?:
- finish a working animation of squares appearing on screen.
- Output rhythm to VGA
- Have score increase if buttons pressed in the right time
- make script to generate rhythm bits

What do you plan to have completed by the end of the third lab session?:
- Multiple songs to choose from

- Fix bugs in edge cases
- Add additional features if time permits (eg. receive sounds from a microphone, output notes to speaker)

What is your backup plan if things don't work out as planned?
- If VGA doesn't work, last resort is moving lights in LEDR


What hardware will you need beyond the DE2 board?
Speakers, Microphone (if time permits)


Motivations
-----------
How does this project relate to the material covered in CSCB58?:
It implements and brings together many components we have used (timers, shifter bits, finite state machines)

Why is this project interesting/cool (for CSCB58 students, and for non CSCB58 students?):
- It's a rhythm game that is made by hardware, not the typical rhythm game programmed in Java

Why did you personally choose this project?:
- It allows us to demonstrate our understanding in many parts of the course syllabus, such as outputting to VGA, shifting bits, using finite state machines, counters, etc.
- Because we love rhythm games
- Because we like music

Updates

Week 1: We attempted to run our code in the FGPA board. Unfortunately the first half of the lab was dedicated to JTAG Chain Errors, and we ended up not being able to fully test our code. We implemented a verilog design of a schematic we drew to draw squares on the VGA module, but it wasn't fully working as intended. Since we weren't able to get anything significant working, we have currently lowered our goal to just process 1 type of squares in 1 horizontal line.
